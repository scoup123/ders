### Derek Walcott, The Sea is History

#### Analysis

The first stanza of the poem are a break from the terza rima structure of the poem where the forces of opposition strongly react when the ruler asks for information regarding the “*martyrs of the battle*” between the rulers and the subjects. The subject replies respectfully that they lie in the “*gray vault*”. By asking this question, the ruler is, in a way, provoking his lowly subject’s “tribal memory”.



What is this “*grey vault*”? It is “The Sea”. The lantern of the caravel is the “*light of benediction*” for the poor native subject, which he calls the Genesis of his tribe. Then the “*packed cries of the slave ships are their Exodus*”. There is a close similarity between the Biblical events like the Exodus, the Ark of the Covenant and the Song of Solomon with the history of wholesale migration of the slave subjects transported in slave ships from Africa.

There is violence and bloodshed in the picture of the *“brigands”* who *“barbecued cattle”,* which leads to an event of fairly recent Caribbean history. Then the poet refers to the *“tidal”* wave swallowing Port Royal, which can easily be compared to Jonah being swallowed by a large fish for transgressing God’s orders. Again the poet makes frequent reference to drowning through which he also shows his sensitivity for the suffering of women as separate entities of the tribe.

There is pathos when the white master asks his native slave, *“But where is your Renaissance?”* Actually the black subject has had no Renaissance. He could have pointed to the presence of the white man on the Islands. But he innocently replies, *“It is locked in the sea-sands.”* There is also a hint of humour in Walcott’s reference to the fish in the sea that resembles the “bald queen”, i.e. Elizabeth I. But soon after, the scene becomes sombre when the native speakers liken the sea-waves to cathedrals.

There is both the pain of suffering and the pain of nostalgia when Walcott refers to the *“spires lancing the side of God/as His son set”*—a poignant pun on the death of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who died to save mankind. For the Blacks, the Emancipation Act of 1863 was meant as deliverance, but the celebration of partial victory of the blacks “*Vanishes swiftly as the sea’s lace drives in the sun”*. The sight of the sea-foam is one of pure beauty that betrays Walcott’s deep feelings for his Island. But the independence of the islanders has meant nothing but racial tension, as it has unleashed a different kind of violence, in fighting and distress. This proves that the different communities in the West Indies have not been able to live together as a homogenised group of people.

Here Walcott uses the animal and insect imagery to describe the mixed psyche of the races in the West Indies. The readers witness metaphors like “*the bullfrog bellowing for a vote, the “mantis, like khaki police*” and the “*furred caterpillars of judges*.”

After looking at the manmade chaos in the West Indies, Walcott writes in a sad tone that “*each rock*”, i.e. each tribe in his country, has broken into its own nation so the sea, the recorder of their unwritten history, has the impudence to indulge in a “*salt chuckle*”. Before Independence, it was “*other people’s history written upon the Caribbean consciousness, but now it is time for individual history, an independent nation’s history to assert itself*.”

Walcott sees some inkling of the sound of history’s real beginning for the West Indies. But even at the end, he challenges the concept of history as he thinks that the idea of history is like a deity, a force or a science. Just as he attempts to break with tradition of the English language and literature in order to invest his diction with the blood of his tribe, so too, he wants to break with traditional definition and knowledge of all that constitute history.

Walcott sees his Caribbean heritage as a set of collected values that he can use to challenge the materialistic, consumer society the Islands have become, where individualism is only another brand of self-centeredness. Even as he calls his poetic talents a “*mulatto of style*”, he wishes the multiracial, polyglot islanders to liberate themselves and world’s major cultures.

Walcott’s deepest desire is to give his “*subdued society*” a voice of its own. He also perhaps wishes for a future where the dilemma of being black in skin and white in mind can be solved too all times to come.

### Copernicus, Commentariolus

The ***Commentariolus*** (*Little Commentary*) is [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus)'s brief outline of an early version of his revolutionary [heliocentric theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism) of the universe. After further long development of his theory, Copernicus published the mature version in 1543 in his landmark work, *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium* (*On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres*).

### Galileo, Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany

#### Background

[Christina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_of_Lorraine) was the daughter of [Charles III of Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III,_Duke_of_Lorraine) and granddaughter of [Catherine de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de%27_Medici).

In 1611 Galileo was informed by a friend, [Cigoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigoli), “ill-disposed men envious of your virtue and merits met [to discuss]... any means by which they could damage you.” The number of scholars who disapproved with his *Discourse on Floating Bodies*, or were simply ill-spirited toward Galileo grew, but other than one letter from Niccolò Lorini there was not much discussion about the issue for the remainder of the year.

Late in 1613, Galileo's former student [Benedetto Castelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Castelli), a [Benedictine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine) [monk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk), wrote to Galileo about the events at a recent dinner with the Grand Duke [Cosimo II de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosimo_II_de%27_Medici). In the course of conversation at the dinner [Cosimo Boscaglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosimo_Boscaglia), a professor of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), argued that the motion of the Earth could not be true, being contrary to the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible). After dinner ended, Castelli was called back to answer scriptural arguments against the motion of the Earth from Christina. The monk took on the role of [theologian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) in response, and convinced everyone there except the Duchess (whom he thought was arguing mainly to hear his answers) and Boscaglia (who said nothing during this dialogue).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_Grand_Duchess_Christina#cite_note-Moss-1) Galileo decided to address Christina because of her desire to learn more about astronomy. Christina's position of power would also give the letter more exposure to other nobles and Church leaders.

Galileo replied with a long letter giving his position on the relation between science and Scripture. By 1615, with the controversy over the Earth's motion widespread and increasingly dangerous, Galileo revised this letter and greatly expanded it; this became the *Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina*. The letter circulated in manuscript but was not printed until much later, when the [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) had condemned Galileo. It appeared in [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg) in 1636 with both Italian and Latin text, as seen in the top right image. It was suppressed in Catholic jurisdictions, as were all works of Galileo at that period which dealt with that subject.[*citation needed*]

#### Contents of Letter

Galileo argued that the Copernican theory was not just a mathematical calculating tool, but a physical reality. The letter includes a direct paragraph in which Galileo wrote:

> I hold the sun to be situated motionless in the center of the revolution of the celestial orbs while the earth rotates on its axis and revolves about the sun. They know also that I support this position not only by refuting the arguments of Ptolemy and Aristotle ... especially some pertaining to physical effects whose causes perhaps cannot be determined in any other way, and other astronomical discoveries; these discoveries clearly confute the Ptolemaic system, and they agree admirably with this other position and confirm it.

---

This approach caused some, including Dominican friar Niccolò Lorini, to complain to the [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition), which tried and eventually condemned Galileo of suspicion of [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy).

#### Methodology of the letter

Galileo starts the letter with a little flattery of the Grand Duchess. He tries to build her up as an authority figure and then presents his own credentials to show that he has similar authority. Since The Grand Duchess was a person of high authority but did not have much knowledge in the field of astronomy he was able to write the letter in a way the common person is able to understand. He attempted to manipulate the Duchess by attempting to attain her sympathy by mentioning the unfair attacks made against his honor. He tried to portray “himself as a man of good will who seeks only to disclose the truth.” He states he was motivated to write the letter to justify himself to men of religion he holds in great esteem.

### René Descartes, Meditations on First Philosophy: I and II

#### First Meditation: skeptical doubts 

##### Summary 

The First Meditation, subtitled "What can be called into doubt," opens with the Meditator reflecting on the number of falsehoods he has believed during his life and on the subsequent faultiness of the body of knowledge he has built up from these falsehoods. He has resolved to sweep away all he thinks he knows and to start again from the foundations, building up his knowledge once more on more certain grounds. He has seated himself alone, by the fire, free of all worries so that he can demolish his former opinions with care.

The Meditator reasons that he need only find some reason to doubt his present opinions in order to prompt him to seek sturdier foundations for his knowledge. Rather than doubt every one of his opinions individually, he reasons that he might cast them all into doubt if he can doubt the foundations and basic principles upon which his opinions are founded.

Everything that the Meditator has accepted as most true he has come to learn from or through his senses. He acknowledges that sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn't worry himself about that.

However, the Meditator realizes that he is often convinced when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things--women and fish, in the case of a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.

On further reflection, the Meditator realizes that even simple things can be doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our conception of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses would not have been created by a perfect being.

The Meditator finds it almost impossible to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counter-balance his habitual way of thinking. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.

##### Analysis

The First Meditation is usually approached in one of two ways. First, it can be read as setting the groundwork for the meditations that follow, where doubt is employed as a powerful tool against Aristotelian philosophy. Second, it can, and often is, read standing on its own as the foundation of modern skepticism. We will briefly discuss these complementary readings in turn.

Descartes saw his *Meditations* as providing the metaphysical underpinning of his new physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes' day placed a great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator's suggestion that all one's most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will be reading the *Meditations.* The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay lip service to the orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded.

Reading the First Meditation as an effort to coax Aristotelians away from their customary opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous "Dream Argument" to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming--that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking--or the possibility of a universal dream--that my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later "Evil Demon Argument." The latter suggests that all we know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The "Painter's Analogy," which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.

The *Meditations* can be seen to follow the model of St. Ignatius of Loyola's *Spiritual Exercises.* The first step in the Jesuit exercises is to purge oneself of one's attachment to the material, sinful world. In the First Meditation, Descartes leads us through a similar purgation, though with a different purpose. Here he wants to persuade his Aristotelian readers to purge themselves of their prejudices. He also hopes to lead the mind away from the senses that are so heavily relied upon by the Aristotelians. In the meditations that follow, he will argue that our most certain knowledge comes from the mind unaided by the senses. Lastly, this process of radical doubt will hopefully rule out any doubts from the positive claims Descartes will build up in the next five meditations. Read in the wider context of the *Meditations,* these skeptical doubts are a means to the end of preparing a resistant audience to the metaphysics Descartes plans to build.

Read on its own, the First Meditation can be seen as presenting skeptical doubts as a subject of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes was the first to raise the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight to the heart of the Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.

No one actually lives skepticism--no one actually doubts whether other people really exist--but it is very difficult to justify a dismissal of skepticism. Western philosophy since Descartes has been largely marked and motivated by an effort to overcome this problem. Particularly interesting responses can be found in Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein.

We should note that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and rational doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects the possibility that he might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.
